SudokuSolver
============
This project contains 
 *  a `Grid` object baked by a two dimensional array of int `int[9][9]`.
 *  a `Solver` interface with a `solve` method that returns a solved `Grid`
 *  Some implementations of `Solver` with differents strategies like /brut force/ or /smarter/ ones. 
 
Since this project is for experiment purpose, there are some test cases to valid various implementations and a `SpeedTest` to check performances.
